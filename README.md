# DK-52_Donkey_Kong_in_Java_bottom_screen

This game was created during my course of User Interface in Java at the PJATK academy!

The game only involves the bottom part of the original game, per project's requirements

**Controls:**
Arrow left/right - move in the respective directions
Arrow up - jump(where not obstructed), climb the ladder
Arrow down - walk down the ladder

**About the game's implementation:**
The game is an endless loop, the "tick" moving the dangerous barrels and platforms speeds up every time the player jumps or completes the level. Unlike other objects, the player
can move without being restrained by the tick
