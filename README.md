# DK-52_Donkey_Kong_in_Java_bottom_screen

This game was created during my course of User Interface in Java at the PJATK academy!

The game only involves the bottom screen as per project's requirements

Controls:
Arrow left/right - move in the respective directions
Arrow up - jump(where not obstructed), climb the ladder
Arrow down - walk down the ladder

About the game's implementation:
The game is an endless loop, the "tick" moving the dangerous barrels and platforms slightly speeds up every time the player jumps or completes the level, the player
can move without being restrained by the "tick"

Goal of the game:
As of now there's no score system or endgame implemented, so it truly is an endless loop(as per the project's specifications)
